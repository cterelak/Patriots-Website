            <h1>The Super Bowl</h1>
            <p> The Super Bowl is the trophy awarded to the team that wins the NFL championship at the end of the season. After the seventeen-game regular season, seven teams from each conference make the playoffs based on their win loss record. The playoffs are single-elimination, meaning each game is do-or-die as teams try to advance through the Wild Card round, Divisional round, and Conference Championships. The winners of the AFC and NFC then face each other in the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is one of the biggest and most watched sporting events in the world and is considered the most important championship in American football. The first Super Bowl was played in 1967, and it has grown into a major cultural event. Here is a link to see all past Super Bowl champions:

            <h1>Illustrious Patriots Championship History</h1>
            <p> Since the New England Patriots were founded in 1959, the franchise has won the Super Bowl six times. Their championships came in the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 seasons. This total puts the Patriots tied for the most Super Bowl wins in NFL history. The team has also appeared in the Super Bowl eleven times overall, which is the most of any franchise, meaning they have finished as runner-up five times. Along with the Lombardi Trophy, the Super Bowl also awards the Super Bowl MVP to the most valuable player of the game. The Patriots have had several players win this award. Tom Brady won it four times (Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, and LI), Deion Branch won in Super Bowl XXXIX, and Julian Edelman won in Super Bowl LIII. These awards highlight how successful and impactful Patriots players have been during the teams championship runs.</p>

            <h1>2015 Patriots Team</h1>
            <p>The 2014 2015 New England Patriots are the most recent Patriots team to win the Super Bowl during that era. They finished the regular season with 12 wins and earned the top seed in the AFC East. In the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship in a dominant performance over the Indianapolis Colts before advancing to Super Bowl XLIX against the Seattle Seahawks. The championship game went down to the final seconds, where rookie Malcolm Butler made a famous goal-line interception to secure a 28 to 24 victory for New England. Rob Gronkowski led the team in receiving yards that season, and Tom Brady had another standout year at quarterback. Along with winning the Super Bowl, Brady was named Super Bowl MVP, and several Patriots players earned Pro Bowl honors for their performances during the season. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2014.htm">2015 Team Info</a></a></p>
